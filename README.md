# 🚗 Automotive Object Detection using YOLOv8  
### 🌱 Edunet Foundation × AICTE × Shell — Green Skills Internship  
**Internship Duration:** 27th October 2025 – 27th November 2025  
**Environment:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)  
**Theme:** Automotive – Object Detection  
**Week:** 1

## 🧩 Project Overview  

The **Automotive Object Detection** project focuses on applying Artificial Intelligence to identify and analyze vehicles in real-time using **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once version 8).  
The goal is to create an intelligent system capable of detecting cars, buses, and trucks from road or aerial traffic videos to estimate **traffic density** and assist in **smart city traffic management**.  

This project supports sustainable mobility by helping optimize traffic flow and reduce fuel wastage, contributing to **green technology development**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement  

In modern cities, increasing vehicle congestion leads to:  
- Long travel times and fuel consumption  
- Traffic mismanagement  
- Air pollution due to idling vehicles  

A system that can automatically **detect and count vehicles in real-time** can help traffic authorities make data-driven decisions.  
Thus, this project aims to **detect, classify, and analyze vehicles using AI** for improved road traffic management and sustainability.

## 🎯 Objectives  

1. **Develop an AI-based model** capable of detecting multiple types of vehicles (cars, buses, trucks).  
2. **Use YOLOv8** for accurate and real-time object detection.  
3. **Analyze traffic density** through vehicle counting and visualization.  
4. **Create a scalable model** deployable across various environments.  
5. **Contribute to green mobility goals** through intelligent traffic monitoring.

## 🧾 Key Learnings from Week 1  

- Understood **how YOLOv8 works** for object detection.  
- Learned **dataset structuring** and annotation formats.  
- Set up environment for **training and inference** in VS Code.  
- Planned upcoming stages for fine-tuning the model.  

🤖 Why I Chose YOLOv8

I selected YOLOv8 for this project because it is one of the most advanced and efficient object detection models available. It offers real-time detection, high accuracy, and easy customization, which are essential for automotive AI applications.
Key Reasons:

Real-time performance – Detects multiple objects instantly, ideal for traffic scenes.
High accuracy – Performs well even in crowded or complex environments.
Lightweight and fast – Can run efficiently even without a high-end GPU.
Easy customization – Supports transfer learning and fine-tuning on custom datasets.
Strong community support – Developed by Ultralytics with detailed documentation.

By using YOLOv8, I can ensure that my automotive object detection model is efficient, reliable, and practical for real-world scenarios.

## 🚀 Next Steps (Week 2 Plan)  

1. Begin **training YOLOv8** on the prepared dataset.  
2. Evaluate model performance using validation data (Precision, Recall, mAP).  
3. Visualize training metrics and generate learning curves.  
4. Start **real-time testing** of trained model on sample traffic videos.  
5. Document training results for **Week 2 report submission**.
